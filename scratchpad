notes for cuda branch

i want to have the program be split between gpu compute and cpu to make it
easier on both. obviously some of the checks are difficult to perform
on the gpu, like the full octave checks at 1:~300 scale
but some other things are quite easy to do on the gpu, like crunchifier.
i want to have a good balance between the two. 
well. testing is in order. goodnight for now
